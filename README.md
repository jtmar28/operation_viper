A weather processing app written in python that scrapes and parses data from 
the Environment Canada website at climate.weather.gc.ca. It stores data
in an sqlite database and is capable of plotting a monthly or yearly
graph based on user input. There is also functionality that allows the 
user to update, or download the entire database.

The code for this program is available to view in a public repository
in github.
